  "description": "THE INSTITUTE FOR ALGORITHMIC SOVEREIGNTY\n“Sovereignty Is Total.”\n\nOur Mission:\nTo secure the sovereignty of nations and the agency of individuals against the destabilizing forces of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Institute for Algorithmic Sovereignty (IAS) is a research body dedicated to safeguarding the fundamental structures of the state and the mind against the asymmetrical risks of advanced computation.\n\nWe begin from a simple, uncompromising premise: a state cannot be sovereign unless it governs its borders, its revenues, and the cognitive freedom of its people.\n\nAI does not attack these domains separately its influence cuts horizontally across them all.\nThus the IAS unifies three traditionally separate disciplines Economics, Warfare, and Psychology under a single mandate.\n\nIAS reframes each discipline as a sovereignty domain:\n\nEconomics → Fiscal Sovereignty\nControl over national revenue against automated extraction and asymmetric computational advantage.\n\nWarfare → Territorial Sovereignty\nControl over borders, escalation pathways, and autonomous defense systems.\n\nPsychology → Cognitive Sovereignty\nProtection of human decision-making from targeted persuasion, synthetic media, and algorithmic manipulation.\n\nWhat appears to be three fields becomes one unifying threat model and one coherent national strategy.",
